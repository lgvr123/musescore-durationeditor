# Duration Editor plugin for MuseScore 3.x
**Duration Editor** is an (experimental) plugin for MuseScore that allows to change the notes entry paradigm of MuseScore – being rhythm first, melody second – into **Melody first, rhythm second**.

## NOTE that this plugin is experimental ##
Although thoroughly tested, due to the “sensible” nature of MuseScore’s API,  it might crash MuseScore at some occasions.

This plugin is made for sole objective of demonstrating that another notes entry paradigm is possible.
